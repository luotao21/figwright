// Single source of truth for per-tool timeout budgets, shared by every layer that waits on a tool
// call. A request crosses up to three independent timers, nested outer→inner:
//
//   follower → leader RPC      (follower.ts)        ← outermost, only on multi-node
//     └─ relay → plugin request (relay.ts)
//          └─ UI → sandbox bridge (ui/bridge/sandbox.ts)  ← innermost, closest to the work
//
// If any inner timer is ≥ an outer one, the outer fires first and leaves the inner layer orphaned
// (its work keeps running, its result is later discarded) and reports a vaguer error. So each layer
// must be strictly larger than the one it wraps. We derive all three from one base budget `B` plus a
// per-layer margin, so the innermost (sandbox) always fires first with the most specific error.
//
// Raising any subset in isolation does nothing: the smallest timer along the path caps the call. In
// particular the sandbox bridge defaulted to 30s for every tool, so before this table a heavy tool
// timed out there regardless of the relay/follower budgets. This lives in @figwright/shared precisely
// so the plugin UI (which can't import the mcp package's ToolSpec) reads the same numbers.
